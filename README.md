## Models Implemented

### Simple Linear Regression
- Implementation of simple linear regression to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.

### Multiple Linear Regression
- Extension of linear regression to include multiple independent variables.

### Polynomial Regression
- Modeling non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial terms.

### Ridge Regression
- Implementation of Ridge regression to handle multicollinearity and improve model stability using L2 regularization.

### Lasso Regression
- Applying Lasso regression to perform feature selection and improve model interpretability using L1 regularization.

### Elastic Net Regression
- Combining Ridge and Lasso regression for improved performance and flexibility.

### Logistic Regression
- Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification problems, including hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

### Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Applying cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and tuning hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

## Results

Each notebook includes detailed results and visualizations showcasing the performance of the regression models on different datasets. Key metrics such as accuracy, R-squared, mean squared error, and others are used to evaluate model effectiveness.
